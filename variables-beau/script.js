//Variables

//A variable is a container for value.
//A value can be many things such as number, string, object, function
//With variables, value in the container can change
//To use a variable, you first have to declare it by using var, let or const keyword
var myName;
//After creating the variable, you must initialize a variable
myName = "Beau";

//declare or initialize the variable at once
var state = "Michigan";

console.log("My name is " + myName);

state = "California";

//Naming rules and conventions
//0-9,a-z,A-Z

//use lowerCamelCase
var bestWebsiteEver = "freeCodeCamp";

//variables are case sensitive
//You should not use javascript reserved words as your variable name
//Javascript is a loosely typed language means you don't need to specify what datatype that variable contains
